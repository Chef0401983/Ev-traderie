# Security Audit Report

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Email Subscription Security
- **Issue**: Coming soon emails were only logged to console
- **Fix**: Created proper API endpoint `/api/newsletter/subscribe` with database storage
- **Security**: Added email validation and duplicate prevention

### 2. ✅ Admin Authentication
- **Issue**: Admin routes were using Clerk auth which may not be suitable for admin access
- **Fix**: Created dedicated admin login system with JWT tokens
- **Security**: Separate admin user table with bcrypt password hashing

### 3. ✅ Logo Security
- **Issue**: Using custom SVG code instead of actual logo file
- **Fix**: Created proper logo SVG file and updated Logo component
- **Security**: No security implications, but better maintainability

### 4. ✅ Route Protection
- **Issue**: Admin routes need proper authentication middleware
- **Fix**: Created admin authentication middleware
- **Security**: JWT token verification for admin routes

## Environment Variables Required

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# JWT Secret for admin authentication (generate a strong random string)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here

# Supabase (already configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

## Database Setup Required

Run the SQL commands in `database-setup.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor to create:
- `newsletter_subscribers` table
- `admin_users` table
- Proper RLS policies
- Default admin user (email: admin@yourdomain.com, password: admin123)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Change the default admin password immediately!**

## Security Recommendations

### 1. Environment Variables
- ✅ `.env.local` is properly gitignored
- ⚠️ Ensure JWT_SECRET is a strong random string (32+ characters)
- ⚠️ Rotate secrets regularly in production

### 2. Admin Security
- ✅ Passwords are bcrypt hashed
- ✅ JWT tokens have 24h expiration
- ⚠️ Change default admin password
- ⚠️ Consider adding 2FA for admin accounts

### 3. API Security
- ✅ Input validation on email endpoints
- ✅ Rate limiting should be added (consider adding rate limiting middleware)
- ✅ CORS is handled by Next.js defaults
- ⚠️ Consider adding request rate limiting

### 4. Database Security
- ✅ RLS (Row Level Security) enabled
- ✅ Service role policies properly configured
- ✅ No direct database credentials in frontend code

### 5. File Security
- ✅ No sensitive files committed to git
- ✅ Logo files are properly served as static assets

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying:

1. [ ] Set strong JWT_SECRET environment variable
2. [ ] Run database-setup.sql in Supabase
3. [ ] Change default admin password
4. [ ] Install new dependencies: `npm install`
5. [ ] Test admin login flow
6. [ ] Test newsletter subscription
7. [ ] Verify logo displays correctly

## Admin Access

- **Login URL**: `/admin` (redirects to `/admin/login`)
- **Default Credentials**: 
  - Email: admin@yourdomain.com
  - Password: admin123 (CHANGE THIS!)
- **Dashboard**: `/admin/dashboard`

## Newsletter Management
